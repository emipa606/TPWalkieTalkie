[spoiler]Hey bud, just wanted to plop this here to ask if you can leave a like on this mod? This mod is something I'll be using in my playthroughs from now on, so a like would be cool. Favorite if you want, I don't mind too much about those. :)[/spoiler]

# DESCRIPTION


The Walkie-Talkie is a pre-microelectronics Comms. Console and Orbital Trade Beacon. It requires only 5W of power, costs 40 steel and 1 component to make, and of course, can be placed indoors. Requires Electricity to be researched.

# KNOWN ISSUES

The trade radius is a rough 3 cell area around the Walkie Talkie, but when highlighted or placing it still shows a normal Orbital Trade Beacon's trade radius, being around 7 cells.

Currently incompatible with [RimBank](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2071695947)

# LOAD ORDER

Not really sure, but, I think you want to put this mod as close to core as you possibly can. Above Deep Storage and addons at the least.
